Given two cells on the standard chess board, determine whether they have the same color or not.

Example

For cell1 = "A1" and cell2 = "C3", the output should be
solution(cell1, cell2) = true.



For cell1 = "A1" and cell2 = "H3", the output should be
solution(cell1, cell2) = false.


My solution:
Ok, so looking at a cvherss board we know that the positions will be the same color if the sums of their two locations are both even or both odd. I needed to convert the first character into an ordinal number and then add the two for each cell. I used two for loops with enumerate to accomplish this and then evaluated if they wer both odd or even at the final return statement.

def solution(cell1, cell2):
    val1 = 0
    val2 = 0
    
    for i, char in enumerate(cell1):
        if i == 0:
            val1 = int((ord(char)))
        else:
            val1 += int(char)
    for i, char in enumerate(cell2):
        if i == 0:
            val2 = int((ord(char)))
        else:
            val2 += int(char)
             
    return val1 % 2 == val2 % 2
