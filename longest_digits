Given a string, output its longest prefix which contains only digits.

Example

For inputString = "123aa1", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "123".



Solution:
Create an empty list, res. Iterate through the string and if the value is a digit append to res. If not, break iteration. Then use list comprehension combined with the ''.join() in Pyhton  to return the number value as a string. 

def solution(inputString):
    res = []
  
    for i in inputString:
        if i.isdigit():
            res.append(i)
        else:
            break
    return ''.join([str(x) for x in res])



Someone had posted this as a solution using  the "re" capabilities of Oythion but I am not well versed in that yet. Something to read up on.
def solution(inputString):
    return re.findall('^\d*',inputString)[0]
