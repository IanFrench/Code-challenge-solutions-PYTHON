From Codesignal Challenge:
After recently joining Instacart's beta testing developer group, you decide to experiment with their new API. 
You know that the API returns item-specific display-ready 
strings like 10.0% higher than in-store or 5.0% lower than in-store that inform users when the price of an item is different from the one in-store.
But you want to extend this functionality by giving people a better sense of how much more they will be paying for their entire shopping cart.

Your app lets a user decide the total amount x they are willing to pay via Instacart over in-store prices. This you call their price sensitivity.

Your job is to determine whether a given customer will be willing to pay for the given items in their cart based on their stated price sensitivity x.

Example

For
prices = [110, 95, 70],

notes = ["10.0% higher than in-store", 
         "5.0% lower than in-store", 
         "Same as in-store"]
and x = 5, the output should be
solution(prices, notes, x) = true.

In-store prices of the first and the second items are 100, and the price of the third item is 70,
which means the customer is overpaying 10 - 5 + 0 = 5, which they are willing to do based on their price sensitivity.
