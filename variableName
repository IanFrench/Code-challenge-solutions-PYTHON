Correct variable names consist only of English letters, digits and underscores and they can't start with a digit.

Check if the given string is a correct variable name.

Example

For name = "var_1__Int", the output should be
solution(name) = true;
For name = "qq-q", the output should be
solution(name) = false;
For name = "2w2", the output should be
solution(name) = false.


My solution:
Using for loop and enumerate and then if statements to rule out the False cases.

def solution(name):
    for i, char in enumerate(name):
        if name[0].isdigit():
            return False
        if  char.isalnum() or char == "_":
            pass
        else:
            return False
    return True

   This one uses an existing method in Python that, until I saw it, was unaware of it. Thank you Python.

def solution(name):
    return name.isidentifier()
