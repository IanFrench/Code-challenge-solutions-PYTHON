Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially. Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

Example

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
solution(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.


Solution:
Simple while loop process is what I chose. Set initial height to 0 and days to 1.  The daily changed is just the up minus down. Then so long as the high PLUS the upSpeed is < the desirted we just add a day and increase high by the daily change. Important to remember to evaluate the high plus up becuase once it reaches desired we are done. Same as the problem of the snail climbing up a well. 

def solution(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight):
    high = 0
    days = 1
    daily = upSpeed - downSpeed

    while (high + upSpeed) < desiredHeight:
        high += daily
        days +=1
    return days
