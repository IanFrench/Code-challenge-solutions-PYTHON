Looks like your little brother doesn't want to remember the multiplication table! Instead he wants to play videogames all day long. To teach him a lesson you'd like to write a virus that will pop up in the middle of the game and disappear only when the brother correctly solves several math questions.

To begin with, you need to construct a multiplication table. Given an integer n, return the multiplication table of size n Ã— n.

Example

For n = 5, the output should be

solution(n) = [[1, 2,  3,  4,  5 ], 
                          [2, 4,  6,  8,  10], 
                          [3, 6,  9,  12, 15], 
                          [4, 8,  12, 16, 20], 
                          [5, 10, 15, 20, 25
                          
Code snippet provided is simply a return ...  thusexpecting use of list comprehension.



solution

This one is very similar to a previous exercise where one was required to simply create an empty array of n by n. Only catch was making sure to set the range properly to compensate for the 0 index. 

def solution(n):
    return [[(i*j) for i in range(1, n+1)] for j in range(1, n+1)]
